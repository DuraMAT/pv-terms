Modifying Variables
-------------------

Many variables can be directly used without modification. However, there are many cases where the standard set of variables does not cover a particular application. For this reason, we have provided some standard suffixes that can be appended to a variable name. 

For example, one application might be to compare simulated and measured maximum-power-point power. In this case, the base variable **pmp** can be modified into **pmp_sim** and **pmp_meas**.
